# QGIS_projectHandler
A small python code to help QGIS users handle project files, to share them with other people.
This app goal is to simplify the sharing of QGIS files; 
by inserting the project file it will automatically find all the layer files in you pc and copy them (including the project file) 
in a folder (the same as the project file), ready to be compressed and sent to your colleagues.

To download the app (the exe in the dist folder) click on version under the RELEASES tag (on the right of the screen).
